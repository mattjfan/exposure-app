### app.json
To get your build working, you'll need to add an `app.json` file into your root directory. `app.json` is ignored from git for security reasons, so please don't commit (should be gitignored anyways). I'm looking into solutions for storing this securely in a centralized place but for now just reach out to us over slack if you need it and we can send you a copy.
